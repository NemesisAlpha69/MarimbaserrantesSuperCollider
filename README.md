Analysis:
This piece was created with SuperCollider, blending live sound processing and generative composition. The main components consist of custom SynthDefs for instruments such as blip, reverb, and
bpfsaw, which generate sound through synthesizers and filters. Each performer will interact with
live processing using MIDI or audio inputs, with some sections focused on sound manipulation,
dynamic volume changes, and evolving textures.
Live Performance:
Instruments: Synthesized sounds processed in real time, including marimba-like tones and
noise-based textures.
Sound Generation: Use the custom SynthDef(bpfsaw) for marimba sounds and other evolving textures.
Effects: Reverb, distortion, and dynamic manipulation with real-time adjustments.
Score: Marimba Loop (Synth: blip) Performers will initiate loops that vary in frequency and
duration. These vary in pitch from a 300 Hz base upwards, with random adjustments.
Marimba Variations (Synth: bpfsaw) Dynamic pitch modulation, using Pbind to set randomized note values, pan settings, and filter frequencies.
Sound Layering (Synth: multi) Layer multiple sounds using noise-based effects, producing
rich, resonant textures, to be played in sequence.
Technical Documentation (Code Analysis):
Synth Definitions: Custom SuperCollider SynthDefs for sound generation and processing, including basic tones (sine waves) and more complex effects (filters and delays).
Marimba Sounds: Generated using bpfsaw with modulation of parameters like cfmin, cfmax,
freq, rqmin, and rqmax. Multiple layers of marimba-like sounds are played in parallel for a rich,
textural effect.

Sound Processing: Real-time effects (e.g., Reverb, FreeVerb) are applied to manipulate the
audio dynamically, adding depth and space to the performance. The reverb SynthDef adds atmospheric depth.
Performer Instructions:
Synthesizer Settings: Adjust pitch, timbre, and duration based on the score. Live Manipulation:
Performers can adjust the intensity and density of the sound through real-time control of the synthesizerâ€™s parameters.
Interactivity: Engage with the surrounding performers and live sound processing to create a dynamic, evolving auditory experience.
Performance Notes: The performance should focus on blending acoustic-like marimba sounds
with processed electronic effects, building evolving layers of sound and texture. Engage with both
fixed and real-time elements of the piece to add variety and expression to the performance.
